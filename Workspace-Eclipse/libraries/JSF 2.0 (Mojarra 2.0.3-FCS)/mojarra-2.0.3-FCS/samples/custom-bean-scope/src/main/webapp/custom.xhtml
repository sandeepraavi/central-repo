    Demo Notes
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In all cases, the three expressions above should show the expression
            as <span style="Color:red">Resolved</span></li>
        <li>On the initial render, the <em>PostConstruct</em> status show show a
            value. However, since this scope is tied to the session, clicking
            the reload button should clear that status
        </li>
        <li>If the destroy button pushed, both the <em>PostConstruct</em> and
            <em>PreDestroy</em> status should have a value. This is because the
            scope is destroyed, and then recreated when the view is re-rendered.
        </li>
    </ul>
